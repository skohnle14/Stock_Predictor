## LSTM Stock Predictor Questions Results

In this assignment, I built and evaluated deep learning models using both FNG (Fear and Greed Index) values and closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data.

The lstm_stock_predictor_fng file uses the FNG values to try and predict the closing price of bitcoin. The lstm_stock_predictor_closing file uses previous closing prices to try and predict the next closing price for bitcoin.

### Based on the results, the following questions can be answered:

Which model has a lower loss?

    -The closing price predictor model had a lower loss than the FNG pridictor model.

Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

    -The closing price predictor model tracks the actual values better over time.

Which window size works best for the model?

    -The window size of 1 day works best for the model.
